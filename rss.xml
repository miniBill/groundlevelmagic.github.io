Introduction
HaskElm is a project in which I try and rewrite a Prelude for Haskell that feels like Elm's Prelude.

This set of posts is structured as a log of my explorations, rather than a tutorial or an howto, so it will have warts, false ends and errors (although I'll cut some of the uninteresting ones).

Let's start with a minimal viable example: the target will be to compile the following program:

module Main
  ( main
  ) where

import           CLI

type Flags = ()

type Model = ()

Introduction
In part 1 we tried to work with records in Haskell.

It was painful but we were finally able to compile something using HList and some fairly recent GHC extensions.

In the end I don't think the pain is worth the result (right now), so we'll drop records and Keep It Simple.

Everything is formatted with hfmt, which is an opinionated formatted, Ã  la gofmt or elm-format, so you may not like its style (I don't), but it eliminates bikeshedding and lost time on formatting decisions, so ...]]></description>
